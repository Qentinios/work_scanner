# Work Scanner
Work scanner allows to search for jobs on multiple sites based on any keywords such as "remote", "python" etc.

Every site where you want to look for jobs needs to have own module implemented. This is because sites have own scripts and differ from each other.

# Supported sites
- https://pl.python.org/forum/index.php?board=9.0
- https://www.linkedin.com/
- https://www.pracuj.pl/

If your site is not mentioned, you need to write custom module first.

# Notes
This project is meant to be an example rather than a complex tool. 

Python 3 is required for this module.
